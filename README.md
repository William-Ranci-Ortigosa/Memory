# Memory Game

This project includes DOM methods that create/manipulate elements as well as basic JavaScript variables, conditionals, loops, functions, etc. I also played around with some new CSS animations. 

DOM Methods - createElement, querySelector, getElementById, getAttribute, setAttribute, addEventListener, removeEventListener, innerHTML, appendChild, etc. 

CSS - transform, transition
